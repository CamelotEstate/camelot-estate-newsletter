# Security

In recent months we’ve had issues where
security is concerned. Please remember all visitors either known by the guard
or not need to always sign in at the gate. 

We have engaged and raised concerned with
the security provider company and all issue are still work in progress and we
are closely following up. 

The frequent Load-Shedding being
implemented by the energy provider has been damaging to our gate motor. However,
we have procured an inverter and a battery, that will keep the gate, lights,
electric fence, camera and the intercom system during loadshedding. Please bear
with us while we await the delivery of some of the items that will make our
lives simpler. 

Watch this space new and exciting proposed
upgrades coming in the next couple of months.
